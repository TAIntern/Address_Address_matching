# Production Environment Configuration Guide
# ===========================================

📋 SCOUT CREDENTIALS Configuration (Verified Working)
====================================================

Environment Variables:
ES_URL=https://search-addresses-f7voryraair5mrpw73ub2v3yg4.aos.us-east-1.on.aws
ES_USER=scout
ES_PWD=Trustscout1!

🔧 Setup Methods:
================

Method 1: Lambda Function Environment Variables (Recommended for n8n)
Set in AWS Lambda console:
- ES_USER = scout
- ES_PWD = Trustscout1!
- ES_URL = https://search-addresses-f7voryraair5mrpw73ub2v3yg4.aos.us-east-1.on.aws

Method 2: Local Development Environment Variables
export ES_USER="scout"
export ES_PWD="Trustscout1!"
export ES_URL="https://search-addresses-f7voryraair5mrpw73ub2v3yg4.aos.us-east-1.on.aws"

Method 3: Direct Python Code Setting (Not Recommended)
os.environ['ES_USER'] = 'scout'
os.environ['ES_PWD'] = 'Trustscout1!'

✅ Verification Status:
======================
✅ Scout account verified for tci_base_staging_data access
✅ Successfully upgraded from intern_3 to scout  
✅ 10,000+ real records access permission
✅ Real Address ID extraction functionality
✅ n8n workflow integration ready

🎯 Usage in Code:
================
# Code automatically reads environment variables with priority:
# 1. Environment variable ES_USER (if set)
# 2. Default value "scout" (updated)

from ultimate_address_matcher import UltimateAddressMatcher
matcher = UltimateAddressMatcher()  # Automatically uses scout credentials

🚨 Important Notes:
==================
1. If your boss is already using these credentials, ensure environment variables are properly set
2. Test files won't affect production code (contained in "if __name__ == '__main__'" blocks)
3. Import only loads classes and functions, won't execute test code
4. Lambda functions only need environment variables set to work

🔍 Verify Configuration is Correct:
===================================
Run test script to confirm:
python test_scout_integration.py

Should see:
✅ Account credentials: Scout
✅ Real data access: Yes
✅ n8n workflow ready: Yes
